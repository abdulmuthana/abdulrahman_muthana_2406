	The system is a delivery system that sets up deliveries of groceries to ones home without them having to 
	go to the grocery store. The system also manages other functions like revenue and deliveries from suppliers.
	The way the system works is that first you sign up for an account, or you can use it as a guest(but no 
	information will be saved). You select the groceries you want and then place your order. If you have an 
	account, the order will be saved in the account, if not you just wait for your order to arrive. Also, 
	we can use the system to order products from the suppliers. Other fucntions the system have is calculating
	the revenue, getting customer feedback and functions that would make grocery shopping much faster and easier.
