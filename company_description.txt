Transation: Sell in stores and also have a delivery system that will get 
groceries to customers home when they order online or over the phone.
The software is needed to help customers order thier groceries over the app and have all the groceries available to select 
from. The app will display the cost of the groveries and also how much it will cost them to be delivered to thier location. 

Based on each store one delivery worker will deliver about 50 deliveries, so about 200 deliveries per day so the transactions
will be 200 per day each store.

What data archiving and throughput requirements characterize your company?
	- The company will take about 200 orders everyday per store from the app and that will require a lot of
	data to be sent to us and data to store the orders. Every  customer will have thier own account in the app 
	which they can see thier order history. We'll need a fast system so that it can processes all the orders
	coming in.


The clients are the people in need of groceries and mostly need it to be delivered to their house.

The suppliers are different companies that provide different kind of groceries. For example, Pepsi would deliver soda.
