
14. The information system that is being proposed to be designed is an app that will allow the customers to select 
the groceries that they need and pay for them to get them delivered to thier address.Also, the deliveries can be 
scheduled to a certain day.




15. The company needs it because it will be the way customers get thier groceries without going to the store.



16. In the system there will be features such as selecting the items, checking out the items, paying for the 
items and scheduling the time to be delivered. Each feature will take about a week to be completed. There are four
features, which means that there will be a week each to be implemented. So overall it will take about a month to 
design, implement, and install the system. 



17. There will be three people that will make the system. The designer, a person to implement it and a person to 
install the system. Each person will be paid about 90 dollars an hour. They will work about 6 hours a day, 5 days a
week. 

So, 90 * 6 = 540 a day 
540 * 5 = 2700 a week
2700 * 4 = 10,800 for the whole process for each emlpoyee

meaning that the total cost of the system will be (10,800 * 3) = $32,400.




18. Besides the 3 employees that created the system. There will be an adminstrator, a person that will make sure
the system is working probably around the hour and an engineer to improve the system and make it easier for the customer 
to use. So, the total of people that will carry out everything is 6 people.
